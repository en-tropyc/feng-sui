  - ✅ Key generation: `libas.createKeyPair()`
  - ✅ Individual signing: `libas.falconSign(message, privateKey)`
  - ✅ Individual verification: `libas.falconVerify(message, signature, publicKey)`
  - ✅ Signature aggregation: `libas.aggregate(messages, signatures, publicKeys)`
  - ✅ Aggregate verification: `libas.verify(aggregateSignature, messages, publicKeys)`

### 2. **✅ COMPLETED: Feng-Sui Network Service** (Node.js) - Phase 2A DONE

#### Phase 2A: Core Transaction Processing Engine - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ **Transaction Ingestion API**
  ```javascript
  POST /api/transactions/submit  // ✅ WORKING
  {
    "type": "transfer|mint|burn",
    "from": "sui_address",
    "to": "sui_address", 
    "amount": "1000",
    "nonce": 12345,
    "falcon_signature": "...",
    "public_key": "..."
  }
  ```

- [x] ✅ **Falcon Signature Verification Service**
  - [x] ✅ Individual signature verification using `libas.falconVerify()`
  - [x] ✅ Transaction message standardization and deterministic serialization
  - [x] ✅ Nonce validation and replay protection
  - [x] ✅ Invalid signature rejection and error handling

- [x] ✅ **Transaction Queue & Batching System**

  - [x] ✅ Batching strategy: 100 transactions OR 5 seconds timeout
  - [x] ✅ Priority handling for urgent/large transactions
  - [x] ✅ Queue monitoring and metrics

#### Phase 2B: Signature Aggregation & Settlement - 🚧 IN PROGRESS (NEXT)
- [ ] **Batch Creation & Aggregation**
  - [ ] Collect verified transactions into batches
  - [ ] Aggregate Falcon signatures using `libas.aggregate()`
  - [ ] Verify aggregate signature using `libas.verify()` before settlement
  - [ ] Handle aggregation failures and retry logic

- [ ] **Sui Settlement Integration**
  - [ ] Connect to Sui testnet using `@mysten/sui.js`
  - [ ] Call appropriate settlement functions:
    - `settlement::settle_batch()` for mints/burns
    - `settlement::settle_transfer_batch_with_withdrawal()` for transfers
  - [ ] Sequence management and synchronization with on-chain state
  - [ ] Gas management and transaction confirmation handling

#### Phase 2C: API Endpoints & Status Tracking - 🔄 PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- [x] ✅ **Core API Endpoints**
  - [x] ✅ `POST /api/transactions/submit` - Accept Falcon-signed transactions
  - [x] ✅ `GET /api/transactions/:id/status` - Track individual transaction progress
  - [ ] `GET /api/batches/:id/status` - Monitor batch processing status
  - [x] ✅ `POST /api/verify/status` - Verify signatures
  - [x] ✅ `GET /health` - Service health, metrics, and queue status

- [ ] **Real-time Status Updates**
  - [ ] WebSocket connections for live transaction tracking
  - [ ] Status progression: received → verified → batched → settled → finalized
  - [ ] Error notifications and retry mechanisms

### 3. **User Experience & Client Integration** (Week 3-4) - 🔄 PENDING Phase 2B

- [ ] **Core Client Library** (`@feng-sui/client`)
  ```javascript
  import { FengSuiClient } from '@feng-sui/client';
  
  const client = new FengSuiClient('https://api.feng-sui.network');
  const keyPair = client.generateKeyPair(); // Uses libas
  
  // Simple transfer with auto-escrow management
  const result = await client.transfer('recipient_address', '100');
  
  // Advanced transaction with custom options
  const tx = await client.createTransaction({
    type: 'transfer',
    to: 'recipient_address',
    amount: '100',
    priority: 'high'
  });
  const signedTx = client.signTransaction(tx, keyPair.privateKey);

## 🔬 Technical Architecture - CURRENT STATE

**Key Components:**
- **✅ libas**: BTQ AG Falcon signature library (C++ with Node.js bindings) - FULLY INTEGRATED
- **🚧 Feng-Sui Network**: Off-chain service for aggregation and verification - PHASE 2A COMPLETE, 2B IN PROGRESS
- **✅ Settlement Contracts**: On-chain Sui smart contracts for final settlement - READY
- **🔄 Client SDKs**: Easy integration for wallets and applications - PENDING Phase 2B completion

**Proven Capabilities:**
- ✅ Falcon key generation: `libas.createKeyPair()`
- ✅ Individual transaction signing: `libas.falconSign(message, privateKey)`
- ✅ Individual transaction verification: `libas.falconVerify(message, signature, publicKey)`
- ✅ Signature aggregation: `libas.aggregate(messages, signatures, publicKeys)`
- ✅ Batch verification: `libas.verify(aggregateSignature, messages, publicKeys)`
- ✅ Transaction API: Submit, verify, queue, and track transactions
- ✅ End-to-end API workflow validated

**Current Gap:**
- 🚧 Missing: Actual settlement to Sui blockchain (Phase 2B)
- 🚧 Missing: Batch processing and aggregation in production flow

**Critical Insight:**
The Sui settlement contracts are **quantum-agnostic by design** - they correctly assume all Falcon cryptography happens off-chain in the Feng-Sui network. This is the optimal architecture for post-quantum signatures.
